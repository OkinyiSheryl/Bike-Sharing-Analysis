# Bike-Sharing-Analysis
From a company's perspective, identifying the expected bike demand in a specific area, within a specific time frame, 
can significantly increase revenue and customer satisfaction. Moreover, bike relocation can be optimized to further reduce operational costs.
From a user's perspective, probably the most important factor is bike availability in the shortest wait time, which we can easily see aligning
with the company's interests. In this chapter, we will analyze bike sharing data from Capital Bikeshare in Washington, D.C., USA,
for the period between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012. The data is aggregated on an hourly basis.
This means that no initial and final locations of the individual rides are available, but only the total number of rides per hour. 
Nevertheless, additional meteorological information is available in the data, which could serve as a driving factor for identifying the total number of requests
for a specific time frame (bad weather conditions could have a substantial impact on bike sharing demand)
